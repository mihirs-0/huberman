And during the episode I did on water, I talked about a number of different filtration approaches. Many of those filters will filter out fluoride and you can simply look up \"water filters that eliminate or reduce fluoride.\" And then some people have enough disposable income and/or are concerned enough about fluoride in their drinking water that they will purchase or create very extensive, very thorough filtration systems to completely eliminate fluoride from their drinking water.",

Many of them actually will save you money, both in the short- and long-term, and can really help you improve your oral microbiome, the strength of your teeth, and reduce the number of cavities, maybe even reverse cavities that have begun to form and are not too deep into the tooth yet. And in a really nice way, all of that independent of your stance on fluoride. OK, the next question is about the vagus nerve. By the way, the vagus nerve is the 10th cranial nerve that basically leaves an area right around the region of the neck, involves something called the nodose ganglion.",

In fact, the word \"vagus\" means essentially \"vagabond\" or \"to wander.\" Because when early neuroanatomists started to chart the neural connections from the brain stem into the body and from the body back to the brain, they saw that it was this extensive superhighway, hence the word \"vagabond,\" hence the name \"vagus.\" Now, the vagus nerve has been described gust prominently in pop psychology and popular wellness circles.

There are conditions under which vagal nerve stimulation, either by electrical current or through specific breathing techniques that I'll talk about in a moment, or through other modalities such as pressure massage can cause a calming or a parasympathetic response. But, get this-- anytime someone tells you that vagal nerve stimulation or activating the vagus will calm you down, you just tell them, really? Well, then, why is it that neurobiologists with laboratories use vagal nerve stimulation as a way to try and create more arousal and alertness-- that is, elevated activation of the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system, the one that's sometimes called the fight or flight arm of the autonomic nervous system, although that's a bit too simplistic a name-- in order to try and alleviate depression or in order to try and wake up experimental animals or people undergoing neurosurgery who are drifting toward a coma state? So the reality is that vagal nerve stimulation is not, quote unquote, \"calming.\" The reality is that depending on which pathway, what neuroanatomists call which aspect or which branch of the vagus nerve is stimulated and how it stimulated, you can either get an elevation in alertness, maybe even an anxiety, or a decrement in alertness and an increase in calm.",

Well, I think it's important, of course, to be accurate, but rarely are we able to be both accurate and exhaustive about what any given brain structure or neural pathway does, especially when speaking to the general public. Now on the Huberman Lab podcast, I try to be as exhaustive as possible and offer as many caveats and disclaimers as possible to try and give the information in the most concise, and yet at the same time, accurate, exhaustive way, but I do understand why people have put forth the vagus as a calming tool.",

I want to be really clear about this. Anytime you're talking about a biological or physiological effect-- you could even call it a biohack, even though that's a word I loathe, because I like mechanisms, not hacks. But anytime you're talking about a biological or physiological effect, especially in human physiology, you need to think, are we talking about a mechanical or a chemical stimulation or both?",
