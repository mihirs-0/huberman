Some people like to sleep trackers, using their Eight Sleep or their WHOOP or their Oura Ring or something like that. I'm a fan of sleep trackers, but I think that relying too heavily on sleep scores can be risky. There are data from Alia Crum's Lab at Stanford showing that if people receive a poor sleep score, even though they slept well, their performance will drop. If people get a good sleep score, even though their sleep was lousy, their performance is maintained or even enhanced.",
