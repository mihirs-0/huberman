Now, what differentiates different protein sources has a lot to do with how easily those proteins are assimilated into our body and their amino acid content. Now, in general, how bioavailable a protein is as well as its quality or protein score relates to a number of things, not the least of which is the amount of leucine, which is a particular essential amino acid that we need to get from food. So why is leucine important? Well, leucine is an essential amino acid.",

And some protein sources, such as whey protein, for instance, but also beef, chicken, eggs, et cetera, have high levels of leucine as compared to other types of protein, for instance, collagen protein and some, not all, bone broths. And I'll explain what I mean by that in a moment. So if we just step back from this question and ask it in two parts-- remember, the question was, is there a distinct health advantage to using bone broth or collagen protein versus whey protein? One can be very confident in the answer to that, which is whey protein contains relatively high amounts of the amino acid leucine and therefore is going to be the superior form of protein if your goal is to grow muscle and/or get stronger, to repair muscle, either muscle damage caused by exercise, or simply to engage protein synthesis.",

But independent of exercise, dietary protein, in particular dietary proteins that contain high amounts of leucine or, I should say, relatively high amounts of leucine, like whey protein, will help induce so-called \"muscle protein synthesis,\" which is generally good for us, again. And it's occurring even if we're not exercising. If we are exercising, especially if we're exercising very hard and, in particular, if we're doing a lot of resistance training or, frankly, any amount of resistance training that's taken near or to failure-- so it doesn't even have to be heavy weight, but if you're stressing the muscles hard, then having a quality-protein source that's bioavailable, that is, you can assimilate it, and that has relatively high leucine content is going to be advantageous. So through that lens, I can confidently answer the question by saying that a quality whey protein would be a better choice for a protein as compared to bone broth or a collagen protein, which have relatively low amounts of leucine.",

The oral health experts tell me that it can cause accelerated tooth decay in part through the vasoconstriction and the reductions in saliva. However, there is evidence that nicotine can be a cognitive enhancer, so as long as you're not delivering it through a carcinogenic or otherwise damaging route, such as gum or pouch, it will help you focus more.",
