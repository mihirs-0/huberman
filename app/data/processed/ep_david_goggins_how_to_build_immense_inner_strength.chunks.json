[MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is David Goggins. David Goggins is a retired Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's also a highly accomplished ultramarathon runner. For those of you that don't know, ultramarathons are distances longer than 26 miles and, in David's case, often longer than 200 miles.",

David is also a highly successful writer, having authored two books, the first entitled \"Can't Hurt Me\" and the second entitled \"Never Finished,\" both of which are best sellers.
