What I mean by that is today we talk about the origins of the universe, we talk about the Earth's relationship to the sun and to the other planets, we talk a lot about optics. So not just the neuroscience of vision and our ability to see things up close and far away, but to see things very, very far away or very, very close up using telescopes or microscopes, respectively. So today's discussion is a far-reaching one, literally and figuratively, and one that I know everyone will appreciate because it really will teach you how the scientific process is carried out. It will also help you understand that science is indeed a human endeavor and that much of what we understand about ourselves and about the world around us, and indeed the entire universe, is filtered through that humanness.",

It's entitled \"Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body.\" This is a book that I've been working on for more than five years and that's based on more than 30 years of research and experience, and it covers protocols for everything from sleep to exercise to stress control, protocols related to focus and motivation, and of course I provide the scientific substantiation for the protocols that are included. The book is now available by pre-sale at protocolsbook.com. There you can find links to various vendors. You can pick the one that you like best.",

We also have protocols related to deliberate cold exposure, get a lot of questions about that, deliberate heat exposure, and on and on. Again, all available at completely zero cost.
