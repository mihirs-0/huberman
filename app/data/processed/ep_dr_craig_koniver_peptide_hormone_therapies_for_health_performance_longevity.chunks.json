Dr. Koniver, as he will soon tell you, is not a huge proponent of supplements, but he does mention several that he feels are of particular use, including things like coenzyme Q10, and some of the methylated B vitamins, and he explains why he takes that stance. Today's discussion is really for anybody interested in mental health, physical health, and performance. The reason I say that is that even if you aren't considering taking peptides or already taking peptides, peptides and some of these other compounds I've mentioned sit somewhere between doing nothing except diet and exercise, supplements, which I see as the next step up the ladder in terms of augmenting your health approaches, and then of course, there are a number of prescription drugs, including hormone therapies, such as growth hormone therapies, testosterone therapies, and a number of other things that yes, can modify those hormone pathways, they are, in fact, hormones, but they actually can shut down one's natural production of those hormone pathways.",

In keeping with that, you'll notice that during today's discussion, we talk a fair amount about what the FDA currently allows in terms of prescription peptides, what the FDA has recently removed from the market in terms of peptides. As a very recent update, just prior to the release of this episode, I learned that three peptides, CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, both of which are in the growth hormone secretagogue family, meaning they promote the release of growth hormone, as well as thymosin beta-alpha, which is in the sort of anti-inflammatory and tissue repair pathway, those three are now re-allowed for prescription in the United States.

What sets Joovv lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy device is that they use clinically proven wavelengths, meaning specific wavelengths of red light and near-infrared light in combination to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations. Personally, I used the Joovv whole body panel about three to four times a week, and I use the Joovv handheld light both at home and when I travel.
