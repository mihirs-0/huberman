      "text": "Borque focuses on the actual sensing that occurs within one's gut, just as one would sense light with their eyes or sound waves with their ears for hearing. Our gut contains receptors that respond to specific components of food, including amino acids, fats, sugars, and other aspects of food including temperature, acidity, and other micronutrients that are contained in food that give our gut the clear picture of what is happening at the level of the types and qualities of food that we ingest, and then communicate that below our conscious detection to our brain in order to drive specific patterns of thinking, emotion and behavior. And of course, everybody has heard of our so-called gut sense or our ability to believe or feel certain things based on perceptions that are below or somehow different from conventional language. Today, Dr. Borque teaches us about all aspects of gut sensing, how it occurs at the level of specific neurons and neural circuits, how the brain responds to that, how specific foods and components of food impact not just our feeling of digestion or feeling good or bad about what we ate, but indeed how we feel overall, how safe we feel, how excited we feel, whether or not we feel depressed or sad, angry, or happy.",

The term was coined in 1938 by a German physician. His name was Frederick Fater. And at that time it was a major advancement in our understanding of physiology because he came up with the idea that the organs were not only communicating to organs, in fact, there were cells within the organs that were communicating to other organs through the release of some of these endocrine factors, these neuromodulators or these neuropeptides that we know as hormones.",
      "title_sent": "And in the intestine we have a little bit more of more delicate epithelial layer.",
      "why_sent": "And we think these epithelial layer, there are several different cell types, and one of those is the, so-called enteroendocrine cell, to put it in more simple terms, is a gut endocrine cell or a gut cell that releases hormones."

In the early two thousands when we were starting to be able to identify some of these cells, then it quickly became obvious that these cells, these enteroendocrine cells throughout the lining of the stomach, intestine, colon, they had multiple receptors for multiple nutrients. Like we have the macronutrients, for instance, sugars, fats, proteins, but within them we have a repertoire of molecules, multiple lipids, multiple types of sugars, and so on and so forth. And these cells, depending on their location, they will express different types of receptors or a combination of those receptors. And I say that depending on the location, because when we're eating, let's say an apple, the apple is going to be partially undigested by the time that it enters intestine, but by the time that it gets to the colon, most of those nutrients have being absorbed and perhaps only fibers are surviving to feed off most of the microbes that live in the colon.",

Then the glucose is absorbed by some of the sodium glucose transporters, which are active transporters, and this transporters depolarize the cell. And then once glucose gets inside of the cell, glucose enters the TCA cycle is metabolized and then produces a TP. And the A TP farther activates another voltage gated channel, farther depolarize in the cell, and then the cell releases in turn a transmitter, for instance, glutamate that very rapidly tells the vagus nerve within milliseconds, I got sugar, and it tells it in two phases because that glutamate will activate two different type of receptors, ionotropic, which are very fast, and metabotropic, which are a little bit more delayed. But then the metabolism of that glucose that produces the A TP and farther the polarizes the cell, we believe that it will cause the release of the hormone of the neuropeptide.",

You go and you have the kung pow shrimp or you have the lentil soup at a given place and a few hours later you don't feel right. You start some sweating, some gastric distress, and you develop a pretty broad aversion to that food or maybe even the entire meal, maybe the restaurant, maybe even that entire type of cuisine, depending on how much of a lumper versus a splitter you are, as we say in science, how much you make large bin decisions or fine bin decisions.

I'm deeply grateful because my career has developed there and some of my mentors, Roger Little Andrew Muir and the people that have helped me along the way. And then finally, I want to thank you and your team and congratulate you for the work that you do and that you have created this window for us to come and share with the public a little bit of the work that we do. Perhaps some of that is obviously is based on evidence. Some portion of that is thinking about the future, but I do think that through maintaining the dialogue with the public, that we can continue to understand the world that we live in.",
