He also tells us how to improve our movement patterns for cardiovascular exercise, for sport, for resistance training, across the board, how to move better and how to improve our range of motion with the minimal amount of time investment. We hear a lot about different forms of stretching. We hear about dynamic stretching, we hear about passive stretching.",

Function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers, key to physical and mental health, but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from top doctors on your results. For example, in one of my first tests with Function, I learned that I had too high levels of mercury in my blood. This was totally surprising to me. I had no idea prior to taking the test.",

Comprehensive lab testing like this is so important for health, and while I've been doing it for years, I've always found it to be overly complicated and expensive.
