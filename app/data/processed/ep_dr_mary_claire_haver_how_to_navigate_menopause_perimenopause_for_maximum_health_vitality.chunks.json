A fair amount of our discussion centers around hormone replacement therapy, not just for estrogen but for testosterone in women as well, and the many misconceptions and controversies that exist around hormone replacement therapy for menopause. Dr. Haver explains how the specific timing in which hormone therapy is initiated plays a key role in whether or not the hormone therapy is beneficial for women or not. And of course, today's discussion gets into ways to offset some of the more common difficulties associated with menopause, including sleep issues, hot flashes, inflammation, and more.",

Now, I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. Now, a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there is that you get information back about metabolic factors and hormones and lipids and so forth, but you don't know what to do with that information. With Inside Tracker, they make it very easy to know what to do with those numbers because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of those metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera, and they give you specific directives that you can follow related to nutrition, behavioral modification, supplementation and more. That can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you.",

And there's a reason why I asked about those two things separately. One is just to Perry's Mary Claire Haver: Different than menopause for mental health. So it was a great question. So I just went to APOs Menopause conference in Chicago and there was a whole section on mental health and it was neuroscientists, psychiatrists and menopause specialists all up there discussing the latest data.",

      "text": "It was so fascinating. And so there really is a big difference as far as mental health for what's happening in perimenopause and what's happening post menopause. And as we talked about earlier in perimenopause, we have that hormonal zone of chaos and we see this in the Australian data. It's a four times risk of mental health disorders, especially depression, and then in post menopause, a lot of these things tend to stabilize or get better probably because just the estrogen is bottomed out and the brain is not having to deal with these fluctuations. So we think that the data is looking like the best treatment for the mental health issues in perimenopause is going to be estrogen for stabilization and not the traditional SSRIs SNRIs, the antidepressants and the anxiety meds.",

So I'm having my patients take their progesterone orally at night before they go to bed, and we're seeing better sleep with that. And that was also something covered in detail.

And it sounds like, in fact, it's very clear based on what you've told us, that there are real levers of control including hormone replacement therapy, but other things as well, nutrition, exercise.",
