[MUSIC PLAYING] My name is Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we're talking about neuroplasticity, which is this incredible feature of our nervous system's that allows it to change in response to experience. Neuroplasticity is arguably one of the most important aspects of our biology. It holds the promise for each and all of us to think differently, to learn new things, to forget painful experiences, and to essentially adapt to anything that life brings us by becoming better. So let's get started.",

All of us were born with a nervous system that isn't just capable of change but was designed to change. When we enter the world, our nervous system is primed for learning. The brain and nervous system of a baby is wired very crudely. The connections are not precise, and we can see evidence of that in the fact that babies are kind of flopping there, like a little potato bug with limbs.",

You actually have to go through a series of steps to change your internal state in ways that will allow you to change your brain. Many of us have been captivated by the stories in the popular press about the addition of new neurons, this idea, oh, if you go running or you exercise, your brain actually makes new neurons.

If you're feeling agitation and it's challenging to focus and you're feeling like you're not doing it right, chances are you're doing it right. So once you get this epinephrine, this alertness, you get the acetylcholine released and you can focus your attention, then the question is, for how long? And in an earlier podcast, I talked about these ultradian cycles that last about 90 minutes. The typical learning bout should be about 90 minutes.",

We now know that if you focus very hard on something for about 90 minutes or so, maybe you even do several bouts of that per day, if you can do that-- some people can. Some people can only do one focus bout of learning-- that night and the following nights while you sleep, the neural circuits that were highlighted, if you will, with acetylcholine transmission, will strengthen. And other ones will be lost, which is wonderful because that's the essence of plasticity. And what it means is that when you eventually wake up a couple of days or a week later, you will have acquired the knowledge forever, unless you go through some process to actively unlearn it.",

There is also a way in which you can bypass the need for deep sleep, at least partially, by engaging in what I call non-sleep deep rest, these NSDR protocols. But I just want to discuss the science of this. There was a paper that was published in Cell Reports last year that shows that if people did-- it was a spatial memory task, actually quite difficult one, where they had to remember the sequence of lights lighting up. And if there were just two or three lights in a particular sequence, it's easy.",

If immediately after-- and it was immediately after the learning, the actual performance of this task, people took a 20-minute non-sleep deep-rest protocol or took a shallow nap, so lying down, feet slightly elevated, perhaps, just closing their eyes, no sensory input, the rates of learning were significantly higher for that information than were they to just had a good night's sleep the following night. So you can actually accelerate learning with these NSDR protocols or with brief naps, 90 minutes or less. For many people, letting the mind drift, where it's not organized in thought, after a period of very deliberate, focused effort, is the best way to accelerate learning and depth of learning. I want to synthesize some of the information that we've covered up until now.",
