[music plays] Andrew Huberman: Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials, where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are going to talk about our sense of self, or what's called interoception. Interoception is our sensing of our internal landscape, things like our heartbeat, our breathing, and our gut.",

      "text": "This discussion about sense of self and interoception has many important actionable items that relate to bodily health and brain health. Of all the topics I could cover, this thing that we call sense of self, which is also called interoception, has perhaps the most foundational level of importance for all that we feel, all that we do, and all that we are capable of doing. And I promise that if you can learn a little bit about the mechanisms of self-sensing, of understanding what's going on in your internal milieu, as we say, your internal environment, you will position yourself to do some very simple things that can lead to outsized positive effects on everything from sleep, to body composition, to mental focus, to mood, your ability to regulate stress, and indeed, even your ability to heal and recovery from injuries of different kinds, brain injury and bodily injury. We have a system in our body that connects our brain to all of our bodily organs, and connects all of those bodily organs to our brain. And that communication between brain and body in both directions creates a situation where either we are positioned to do things well, or we are positioned to do things poorly.",

We talked about vagus a little bit earlier, but the vagus nerve, this vagabonding, wandering nerve is involved in everything I've talked about up until now. And the reason I saved it till now rather than mentioning all along is to highlight a specific point, which is that whenever we hear about the vagus in popular culture, it's like, \"The vagus calms you down, it'll mellow you out.\" Actually, most of the time the vagus is stimulatory. When you ingest foods with amino acid, sugars, or fatty acids, the vagus nerve s- gets activated and triggers the release of dopamine. It makes you more alert and go seek more of those [laughs] foods, or what led to those conditions.",

So, you're starting to get the picture that even though the vagus nerve is in the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, it's not a calming system, it's a communication system, and it's a motor system. It communicates brain to body and body to brain, and it changes the function of different organs. Now, one thing that's important to highlight is that stress itself will alter the chemistry of your gut because of the ways that it shuts down the vagus nerve and quiets the neurons that communicate from gut to brain.",

Stress will disrupt your gut and make you feel not good, poor digestion and just lousy, because of the way this, that it shuts down the vagus nerve and the neurons of your gut. It doesn't mess up your gut, it just doesn't let your gut get the signals up to your brain, and it also th- then throws off the chemistry and then there's a whole cascade of effects. The vagus nerve, however, is responsible for emotion. And the way it does that is to pull...... to aggregate the conditions of your gut, the conditions of your heart, and the conditions of your breathing, which includes your diaphragm and lungs, and takes that, kind of as a, a collection of information, and sends it to the brain, and controls what we call your emotions.",

Emotions can be good, or bad, or neutral. So, this thing that we call interoception, the sense of self, I've been building up from very fundamental layers, gut chemistry, spleens, immune systems, autoimmune. All of those things are plugging in like a series of ingredients in a recipe that gives rise to your mood and how you feel. And that mood and how you feel is shown in one location in your body that other people can see, and that's in your facial expressions.",

And what's remarkable, and this is where interoception really, really takes a leap into the incredible, is that there are beautiful studies that show that, for instance, when we know somebody pretty well, and they are going through some sort of experience of any kind, our heart rate actually starts to mimic their heart rate. Our breathing starts to mimic their breathing, even if we aren't conscious of their breathing. Somehow, human beings are able to register the internal state of other beings, and I think probably for animals too, but certainly for other humans, even at a distance. And so your sense of your internal landscape is linked to others.",
