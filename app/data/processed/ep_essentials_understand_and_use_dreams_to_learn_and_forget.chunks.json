[MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we're going to talk about dreaming, learning during dreaming, as well as unlearning during dreaming, in particular, unlearning of challenging emotional events. Now, numerous people throughout history have tried to make sense of dreams in some sort of organized way. The most famous of which, of course, is Sigmund Freud, who talked about symbolic representations in dreams. A lot of that has been kind of debunked, although I think that there's some interest in what the symbols of dreaming are.",

So I think in order to really think about dreams and what to do with them and how to maximize the dream experience for sake of learning and unlearning, the best way to address this is to look at the physiology of sleep, to really address, what do we know concretely about sleep? So first of all, as we get sleepy, we tend to shut our eyes. And that's because there are some autonomic centers in the brain, some neurons that control closing of the eyelids when we get sleepy. And then we transition into sleep.",

So it's really a remarkable stage of life that we have a lot more control and power over than you might believe. So let's start by talking about slow wave sleep or non-REM sleep. So slow wave sleep is characterized by a particular pattern of brain activity in which the brain is metabolically active but that there's these big sweeping waves of activity that include a lot of the brain. Now, the interesting thing about slow wave sleep are the neuromodulators that tend to be associated with it, that are most active and least active during slow wave sleep.",

Now, immediately, you can imagine the ethical implications of this because certain emotions need to be coupled to experiences. But in the clinical setting, the basis of ketamine-assisted therapies are really to remove emotion. Ketamine is about becoming dissociative or removed from the emotional component of experience. So now, we have ketamine, which chemically blocks plasticity and prevents the connection between an emotion and an experience.",

But REM sleep is the one that you're giving yourself every night when you go to sleep, which raises, I think, the other important question, which is how to get and how to know if you're getting the appropriate amount of REM sleep and slow wave sleep. Turns out that for sake of learning new information, limiting the variation in the amount of your sleep is at least as important and perhaps more important than just getting more sleep overall. I find great relief personally in the fact that consistently getting, for me, about 6 hours or 6 and 1/2 hours is going to be more beneficial than constantly striving for eight or nine and finding that some nights I'm getting five and sometimes I'm getting nine and varying around the mean. Now, ideally, you're getting the full complement of slow wave sleep early and night and sleep toward morning, which is REM sleep, which brings us how to get more REM sleep.",
