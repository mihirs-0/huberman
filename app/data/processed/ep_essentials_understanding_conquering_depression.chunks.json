      "title_sent": "What's really striking about this study, is that there was a very significant improvement in mood, and affect, and relief from depressive symptoms in anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people that were subjects in the study who received the psilocybin treatment.",
      "why_sent": "What's really interesting is there are some common themes to psilocybin administration and experience that lead to relief from depressive symptoms, but they are subjectively very varied."

      "text": "It's somehow rewiring associations between events, emotional events, past events, current events, and future events, in ways that allow people to get some sort of relief or distance from these narratives, these depressive stories about their past and present, and allow them to see new opportunity and optimism in the future. One of the most common questions I get for this podcast is about different diets, different regimes, different nutritional plans, things like keto, ketogenic diet, or vegan diets, or intermittent fasting, or the all-meat diet, the so-called Lion Diet, et cetera. There are actually really interesting data relating nutrition and diet to major depressive disorder. There have been some explorations of whether or not a vegan diet can improve symptoms of depression. Not a lot of data, not impressive data.",

      "text": "There have been very few controlled studies looking at the carnivore or all-meat diet. However, the ketogenic diet has been explored for its ability to relieve certain symptoms of depression, in particular to what's called maintained euthymia. Euthymia is the kind of state of equilibrium between a manic episode and a depressive episode in a manic bipolar person. Euthymia is that kind of place in the middle where people feel neither too high nor too low. And there are some interesting studies looking at the ketogenic diet for maintaining euthymia in manic depressives, but also in people with major depressive disorder.",

      "text": "The ketogenic diet, by way of increasing ketone metabolism or shifting brain's metabolism over to ketones, tends to modulate GABA, such that GABA is more active, and adjusts the so-called GABA glutamate balance. This is getting technical, but glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, and their balance is vital for neuroplasticity, for maintaining healthy levels of activity in the brain, et cetera. And so there is decent evidence that people with major depressive disorders, in particular, the people with major depressive disorders that are refractory, meaning they don't respond to classical antidepressants, can benefit, it seems, from the ketogenic diet. It's really interesting that eating in a particular way, lowering carbohydrates to the point where you rely on ketogenic metabolism in the brain, increases GABA, and can provide some relief for depressive symptoms, and that, in particular, seems to have positive effects in people that are refractory, or who don't respond to classic antidepressants. So, today we've covered what at least feels to me like a tremendous amount of material.",

We talked about the symptomatology, we talked about some of the underlying neurochemistry and biology, and then we talked about approaches to deal with it that are really grounded in the neurochemistry and biology. I just want to recap a few of those tools, and what those things are. So, number one, don't overwhelm your pleasure centers, either through activities or compounds. It might seem counterintuitive, but you're setting yourself up for anhedonia and depression if you do that.",

      "text": "Second of all, we talked about the norepinephrine system, and how the norepinephrine system is really deficient in many forms of major depression, and in depression. There is now more deliberate pursuit of norepinephrine-inducing activities that are healthy, that aren't adrenaline seeking per se, things like exercise that will increase our levels of noradrenaline. I'd be remiss if I said that these activities could completely eliminate depressive symptoms in people with major depressive disorder. I don't think that's the case, and again, I want to acknowledge that people with major depressive symptoms often don't have the energy, the willingness, or the capacity to engage in some of these activities. But things like deliberate cold showers, things like regular exercise, they aren't just feel-good activities.",

Then, we talked about EPAs, these essential fatty acids, and it's clear that for most people, getting above a thousand milligrams, and probably even closer to 2,000 milligrams per day of EPAs, can be beneficial for mood, especially in attempts to treat or offset major depressive disorder. We also talked about exercise, and how EPA and exercise on a regular basis can offset these inflammatory pathways. And then we talked about the prescription compounds, and the compounds that are being used mainly in the course of studies of psychiatry and depression, things like ketamine, psilocybin, and related compounds. And then lastly, we talked about ketosis, which may not be right for everybody, but might be right for certain individuals out there who are grappling with this.",
