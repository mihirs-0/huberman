KARL DEISSEROTH: Psychiatry focuses on disorders where we can't see something that's physically wrong, where we don't have a measurable, where there's no blood test that makes the diagnosis, there's no brain scan that tells us this is schizophrenia, this is depression for an individual patient. And so psychiatry is much more mysterious, and the only tools we have are words. Neurologists are fantastic physicians. They see the stroke on brain scans.",

He's saying too much. And so I had these two goals, which I kept in my mind the entire time, and a lot of this trying to find exactly the right word we talked about was on this path of staying excruciatingly, rigorous in the science, and yet letting people see the hope that where things have everybody see that we've come a long way; we have a long way to go. But the trajectory and the path is beautiful. And so that was the goal.",

And at least, from this colleague, you did achieve both, and it's a wonderful-- it's a masterful book, really, and one that as a scientist and somebody who is a fellow brain explorer, hits all the marks of rigor and is incredibly interesting, and there's a ton of storytelling.",

There are other people in our community that, of course, are going to be reaching out on your behalf, but it's incredible that you juggle this enormous number of things, perhaps even more important. However, is that it's all in service to this larger thing of relieving suffering. So thank you so much for your time today for the book and the work that went into the book. I can't even imagine for the laboratory work and the development channel ops and clarity and all the related technologies and for the clinical work you're doing and for sharing with us.",
