Most recently, the plant derived compound kratom, which is readily sold in the US and around the world, and is now used by tens of millions of people daily, and those numbers are increasing fast. Dr. McCurdy's research focuses on understanding how Kratom interacts with our nervous system and affects our physiology and behavior. He also studies its potential for addiction.",

Dr. McCurdy explains how kratom's active compounds work in the brain, why it shares certain similarities to opioid drugs, and critically how crem products available in the US and elsewhere are largely derivatives and isolates of the crem leaf, which is very different in terms of the effects it produces when compared to the traditional leaf products. And unfortunately, that has confused and in many cases, harmed consumers. So today you'll learn about kratom's effects at different doses and when it's sourced in different ways, you'll learn about how it can be a stimulant, how it can increase focus, how it can be a painkiller, how it can increase euphoria, but also its strong potential for addiction.",

Increases in cortisol are great in the early part of the day, but you do not want increases in cortisol in the evening and at night. These roka red lens glasses ensure normal healthy increases in melatonin and that your cortisol levels stay low, which is again what you want in the evening and at night. In doing so, these roka red lens glasses really help you calm down and improve your transition to sleep.",
